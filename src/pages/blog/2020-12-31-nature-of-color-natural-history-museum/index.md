Perhaps it’s the isolated colors that are bringing us down; perhaps what we need is a whole spectrum.

All the shades of the planet are brought together in “The Nature of Color,” a polychrome production at the American Museum of Natural History that delves into the chemistry, the physics, and the culture of the visible spectrum. This show opened back in March and closed swiftly thereafter, along with every other museum exhibition in town. New sanitary restrictions required the reopened installation to remove several interactive exhibits, do away with touchscreens, and eliminate games and puzzles.

The show offers visitors, old but especially young, a broad view of color as both a scientific and a cultural phenomenon — even if, to my eyes, it now feels a bit thin for an exhibition with an additional admission charge. But I’m not the target audience: the masked-up kids in “The Nature of Color” were having a blast, preening in front of projected lights and staring wide-eyed at their prismatic reflections.

## Your eyes don’t perceive color, not exactly.

They perceive light — specifically, light with wavelengths of 380 (violet) to 740 (red) nanometers. Light stimulates the cone cells in your retinas, and then the brain takes over. As Isaac Newton first showed in his “Opticks” of 1704, color is not an inherent property of objects (excepting luminescent ones). Color is, rather, the effect of an object’s reflection of certain wavelengths of visible light, and absorption of the rest.

The kids’ crack Newtonian lessons begin in the first groovy gallery of “The Nature of Color,” which is equipped with two sets of oscillating light bulbs, one white and one yellow. When the yellow ones go on it makes everything in the room look gray, unless you are wearing a yellow rain slicker or carrying a rubber duck. When the white lights are on everything looks normal, proving that white is the sum of all colors. Later in the show children can boogie in front of beams of colored light, and can discover the secrets of additive color mixing if they aren’t too in love with their own multicolored shadows.

We humans have a trichromatic view of the world, with cones aligned to red, green and blue. Other species have other perceptions — both bees and reindeer can see ultraviolet wavelengths — and, evolutionarily speaking, color has allowed us to find love or find food, or else to avoid becoming someone else’s lunch. The rainbow lorikeet, resident of the Philippines and New Guinea, has riotously parti-colored plumage on its breast (the better to attract a mate), but tail feathers of solid green (the better to blend into the trees).

Other species making use of color for courtship include the fan-throated lizard, with a wattle of iridescent blue and orange, and the Siamese fighting fish, its tail bristling with blood-orange finnage. As for our own species’ pigmentation, a photo display by the Brazilian photographer Angélica Dass pictures humans of all “races” — the word, appropriately for a science museum, appears in quotes in the wall text — classified according to the one true universal color language: the Pantone palette. (I threw a selfie of my own into Photoshop and grabbed a pixel from my skin. Under even lighting, my “white” skin appears to be Pantone 481c.)

Humanity’s favorite color, polls confirm year after year, is blue. It was also, for centuries of Western art history, the most expensive color, produced from rare lapis lazuli. (In the past you’d paint the Virgin Mary wearing pricey blue as a symbol of your devotion, though if you did so today you might get brought up on charges of abetting a terrorist organization: Lapis lazuli comes chiefly from mines in Afghanistan, many controlled by the Taliban.) Its rarity endured until the early 18th century, when a German color grinder accidentally contaminated a batch of red with some oil and ended up with a rich aqua he called Prussian blue. It was the first ever cheap synthetic pigment, and it set off a “blue fever” as far as Japan, where Hokusai and other printmakers used the rare imported color.
